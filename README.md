## Why I chose this article

This article reflects on the emergence of AI tools in the software engineering world. What stood out to me is the balanced arguments that it made. It did not say that AI is the best thing since sliced bread, but also did not talk about how it is useless and not worth the hype. They were good points and balanced. The author gives examples showing when AI stands out the most, such as automating repetitive tasks, and assisting with documentation, as well as talking about the issues, such as hallucinations.

What I found most interesting is the the fact that they did not talk about AI replacing devs, but rather changing their jobs to be more PM like. More designing and problem solving, with AI helping you write the code faster.

I believe this type of article and writing is really as we approach these uncharted territories. Articles like these help us move forward and navigate these uncertain times, without spreading too much fear or giving hope .


## Majo's comment:
This article offers a deep dive into the rapid evolution of AI tools in software engineering over the past two years, from simple autocomplete enhancements to sophisticated AI coding agents. Birgitta Böckeler’s firsthand experience as a Thoughtworks engineer provides practical insights into how developers can effectively collaborate with AI, navigate its limitations and biases, and leverage emerging workflows. It is essential reading for anyone interested in the intersection of AI and coding. Nice.
